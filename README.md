# sparkFun_Triad

A combination of 3 sensors(UV,NIR,VIS) used for spectral analysis of compounds.
The purpose of this one is to measure how much ethanol(`CH3CH2OH`) content is composed in a given solution using Beer's Laws on light absorbance and transmittance.

In the end we shall calibrate it with pure water readings( and then judging by how much content
normal breatherizers deem harmfull, we can shine light on a target's surface to tell how much they have taken.

The challenge is humans are organic, and we have diffrent measurements of Hydro carbons, so a fat person may yield completely different results
compared to a thin one after taking the same exact content of alcohol.

But hey we wanna try, atleast let it be possible to tell the exact content in a drink or solution. then we shall proceed.
In this project, our humans will be solutions at first.
